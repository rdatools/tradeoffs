# Notable Map Ratings

The congressional ratings are for the BAF's in the `notable_maps` directories.
They were pulled from DRA using the scripts in the `alecramsay/pg` repo.
They were copied from the `docs/_data` directory there on 02/20/24 and lightly edited for formatting.

The ratings for state legislative plans were collected by hand.
The corresponding maps are copied in DRA by alec@davesredistricting.org.
