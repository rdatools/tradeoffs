# What have we learned?

*   Approximate root maps are not stable wrto DRA ratings dimensions:
    Even if changes in 'energy' are small, ratings can change significantly.
    The process finds multiple local minima, not a global one.

    Consequently, root maps are not a particularly useful baseline against 
    which to compare other maps.

*   The plans in a ReCom ensemble don't push the boundaries of DRA ratings:
    We can push the frontiers of the ensemble plans with goal-directed search,
    but frequently the human-drawn DRA Notable Maps can have higher ratings.
